# Grasseh's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for UNIX based systems. These are fully tested on Ubuntu and should be functional on OSX.

## Installation

To install, run the following commands in your terminal :

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:Grasseh/dotfiles.git
    cd ~/dotfiles
    bash init.sh
    source ~/.bash_profile

You need sudo rights to run some commands in the bash file.
You may need to enter your sudo password during the execution of the scripts.
You will need to enter a MySQL password during the execution, if on Ubuntu.

## Sources
My OSX dotfiles were originally forked from https://www.github.com/franatieu/Dotfiles. They've been heavily edited since.
